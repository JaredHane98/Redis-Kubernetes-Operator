                        RecursiveReadOnly specifies whether read-only mounts should be handled
                        recursively.

                        If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                        If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                        recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                        recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                        field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                        supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                        an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                        If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
                        None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).

                        If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.
